  license to the User Content as set forth above; and (ii) neither the User Content nor your

  submission, uploading, publishing or otherwise making available of such User Content nor

<p>
  You agree to not provide User Content that is defamatory, libelous, hateful, violent, obscene,

  pornographic, unlawful, or otherwise offensive, as determined by RIDEY in its sole discretion,

<p>You understand that use of the Services may result in charges to you for the services or goods

you receive from a Third Party Provider (&quot;Charges&quot;). After you have received services or goods

obtained through your use of the Service, RIDEY will facilitate your payment of the applicable

Charges on behalf of the Third Party Provider, as such Third Party Provider&#39;s limited payment

collection agent. Payment of the Charges in such manner shall be considered the same as

payment made directly by you to the Third Party Provider. Charges will be inclusive of

applicable taxes where required by law. Charges paid by you are final and non-refundable, unless

otherwise determined by RIDEY. You retain the right to request lower Charges from a Third

Party Provider for services or goods received by you from such Third Party Provider at the time

you receive such services or goods. RIDEY will respond accordingly to any request from a Third

Party Provider to modify the Charges for a particular service or good.</p>
<p>All Charges are due immediately and payment will be facilitated by RIDEY using the payment

method designated in your Account, after which RIDEY will send you a receipt by email. If your

primary Account payment method is determined to be expired, invalid or otherwise not able to

be charged, you agree that RIDEY may, as the Third Party Provider&#39;s limited payment collection

agent, use a secondary payment method in your Account, if available.</p>
<p>As between you and RIDEY, RIDEY reserves the right to establish, remove and/or revise

Charges for any or all services or goods obtained through the use of the Services at any time in

RDEYs’ sole discretion. RIDEY will use reasonable efforts to inform you of Charges that may

apply, provided that you will be responsible for Charges incurred under your Account regardless

of your awareness of such Charges or the amounts thereof. RIDEY may from time to time

provide certain users with promotional offers and discounts that may result in different amounts

charged for the same or similar services or goods obtained through the use of the Services, and

you agree that such promotional offers and discounts, unless also made available to you, shall

have no bearing on your use of the Services or the Charges applied to you. You may elect to

cancel your request for services or goods from a Third Party Provider at any time prior to such

Third Party Provider&#39;s arrival, <u>in which case you may be charged a cancellation fee.</u></p>
<p>This payment structure is intended to fully compensate the Third Party Provider for the services

or goods provided. RIDEY has designated a portion of your payment as a tip or gratuity to the

Third Party Provider at Your Discretion. Any representation by RIDEY (on RIDEY website, in

the Application, or in RIDEYs’ marketing materials) to the effect that tipping is &quot;voluntary,&quot;

&quot;not required,&quot; and/or &quot;included&quot; in the payments you make for services or goods provided is not

intended to suggest that RIDEY provides any additional amounts, beyond those described above,

to the Third Party Provider. You understand and agree that, while you are free to provide

additional payment as a Tip or gratuity to any Third Party Provider who provides you with

services or goods obtained through the Service, you are under no obligation to do so. Gratuities

are voluntary. After you have received services or goods obtained through the Service, you will

have the opportunity to rate your experience and leave additional feedback about your Third

Party Provider.</p>
<p><b>Repair or Cleaning Fees.</b></p>
<p>You shall be responsible for the cost of repair for damage to, or necessary cleaning of, Third

Party Provider vehicles and property resulting from use of the Services under your Account in

excess of normal &quot;wear and tear&quot; damages and necessary cleaning (&quot;Repair or Cleaning&quot;). In the

event that a Third Party Provider reports the need for Repair or Cleaning, and such Repair or

Cleaning request is verified by RIDEY in RIDEYs’ reasonable discretion, RIDEY reserves the

right to facilitate payment for the reasonable cost of such Repair or Cleaning on behalf of the

Third Party Provider using your payment method designated in your Account. Such amounts will

be transferred by RIDEY to the applicable Third Party Provider and are non-refundable.</p>

<p>RIDEY SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,

EXEMPLARY, PUNITIVE, OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, INCLUDING LOST

PROFITS, LOST DATA, PERSONAL INJURY, OR PROPERTY DAMAGE RELATED TO,

<p>THE LIMITATIONS AND DISCLAIMER IN THIS SECTION 5 DO NOT PURPORT TO

LIMIT LIABILITY OR ALTER YOUR RIGHTS AS A CONSUMER THAT CANNOT BE

<p>You agree to indemnify and hold RIDEY and its officers, directors, employees, and agents

harmless from any and all claims, demands, losses, liabilities, and expenses (including attorneys&#39;

fees), arising out of or in connection with: (i) your use of the Services or services or goods

obtained through your use of the Services; (ii) your breach or violation of any of these Terms;

(iii) RIDEY use of your User Content; or (iv) your violation of the rights of any third party,

including Third Party Providers.</p>
<p><b>6. Dispute Resolution</b></p>
<p><b>Arbitration.</b></p>
<p>You agree that any dispute, claim or controversy arising out of or relating to these Terms or the

breach, termination, enforcement, interpretation or validity thereof or the use of the Services

(collectively, &quot;Disputes&quot;) will be settled by binding arbitration between you and RIDEY, except

that each party retains the right to bring an individual action in small claims court and the right to

seek injunctive or other equitable relief in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual

or threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a party&#39;s copyrights, trademarks,

trade secrets, patents or other intellectual property rights. You acknowledge and agree that you

and RIDEY are each waiving the right to a trial by jury or to participate as a plaintiff or class in

any purported class action or representative proceeding. Further, unless both you and RIDEY

otherwise agree in writing, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person&#39;s claims, and

may not otherwise preside over any form of any class or representative proceeding. If this

specific paragraph is held unenforceable, then the entirety of this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section

will be deemed void. Except as provided in the preceding sentence, this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot;

section will survive any termination of these Terms.</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Rules and Governing Law.</b></p>
<p>The arbitration will be administered by the American Arbitration Association (&quot;AAA&quot;) in

accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules and the Supplementary Procedures for

Consumer Related Disputes (the &quot;AAA Rules&quot;) then in effect, except as modified by this &quot;Dispute

Resolution&quot; section. (The AAA Rules are available at <a href="https://www.adr.org/arb_med" target="_blank">www.adr.org/arb_med</a> or by calling the

AAA at 1-800- 778-7879 FREE.) The Federal Arbitration Act will govern the interpretation

and enforcement of this Section.</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Process.</b></p>
<p>A party who desires to initiate arbitration must provide the other party with a written Demand for

Arbitration as specified in the AAA Rules. (The AAA provides a form Demand for Arbitration at

<a href="https://www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175" target="_blank">www.adr.org/aaa/ShowPDF?doc=ADRSTG_004175</a> The arbitrator will be either a retired judge

or an attorney licensed to practice law in the state of North Dakota and will be selected by the

parties from the AAA&#39;s roster of consumer dispute arbitrators. If the parties are unable to agree

upon an arbitrator within seven (7) days of delivery of the Demand for Arbitration, then the

AAA will appoint the arbitrator in accordance with the AAA Rules.</p>
<p><b>Arbitration Location and Procedure.</b></p>
<p>Unless you and RIDEY otherwise agree, the arbitration will be conducted in the county where

you reside. If your claim does not exceed $10,000, then the arbitration will be conducted solely

on the basis of documents you and RIDEY submit to the arbitrator, unless you request a hearing

or the arbitrator determines that a hearing is necessary. If your claim exceeds $10,000, your right

to a hearing will be determined by the AAA Rules. Subject to the AAA Rules, the arbitrator will

have the discretion to direct a reasonable exchange of information by the parties, consistent with

the expedited nature of the arbitration.</p>
<p><b>Arbitrator&#39;s Decision.</b></p>
<p>The arbitrator will render an award within the time frame specified in the AAA Rules. The

arbitrator&#39;s decision will include the essential findings and conclusions upon which the arbitrator

based the award. Judgment on the arbitration award may be entered in any court having

jurisdiction thereof. The arbitrator&#39;s award damages must be consistent with the terms of the

&quot;Limitation of Liability&quot; section above as to the types and the amounts of damages for which a

party may be held liable. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor

of the claimant and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by the claimant&#39;s

individual claim. If you prevail in arbitration you will be entitled to an award of attorneys&#39; fees

and expenses, to the extent provided under applicable law. RIDEY will not seek, and hereby

waives all rights RIDEY may have under applicable law to recover, attorneys&#39; fees and expenses

if RIDEY prevail in arbitration.</p>
<p><b>Fees.</b></p>
<p>Your responsibility to pay any AAA filing, administrative and arbitrator fees will be solely as set

forth in the AAA Rules. However, if your claim for damages does not exceed $75,000, RIDEY

will pay all such fees unless the arbitrator finds that either the substance of your claim or the

relief sought in your Demand for Arbitration was frivolous or was brought for an improper

purpose (as measured by the standards set forth in Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 11(b)).</p>
<p><b>Changes.</b></p>
<p>Notwithstanding the provisions of the modification-related provisions above, if RIDEY changes

this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section after the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any

subsequent changes to these Terms), you may reject any such change by providing RIDEY

written notice of such rejection by mail or hand delivery to: RIDEY TECHNOLOGIES INC,

Attn: Dispute Resolutions, 3523 45th ST S, # 177, Fargo, ND 58104, or by email from the email

address associated with your Account to: <a href="support@goridey.com" target="_blank">support@goridey.com</a>, within 30 days of the date such

change became effective, as indicated in the &quot;Last update&quot; date above. In order to be effective,

the notice must include your full name and clearly indicate your intent to reject changes to this

&quot;Dispute Resolution&quot; section. By rejecting changes, you are agreeing that you will arbitrate any

Dispute between you and RIDEY in accordance with the provisions of this &quot;Dispute Resolution&quot;

section as of the date you first accepted these Terms (or accepted any subsequent changes to

these Terms).</p>
<p><b>7. Other Provisions</b></p>

<p><b>Choice of Law.</b></p>
<p>These Terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of North

Dakota, U.S.A., without giving effect to any conflict of law principles.</p>
<p><b>Notice.</b></p>
<p>RIDEY may give notice by means of a general notice on the Services, electronic mail to your

email address in your Account, or by written communication sent by first class mail or pre-paid

post to your address in your Account. Such notice shall be deemed to have been given upon the

expiration of 48 hours after mailing or posting (if sent by first class mail or pre-paid post) or 12

hours after sending (if sent by email). You may give notice to RIDEY, with such notice deemed

given when received by RIDEY, at any time by first class mail or pre-paid post to RIDEY

TECHNOLOGIES INC. Attn: User Notices - Legal, 3523 45th ST S # 177, Fargo ND 58104.</p>
<p><b>General.</b></p>
<p>You may not assign these Terms without RIDEY prior written approval. RIDEY may assign

these Terms without your consent to: (i) a subsidiary or affiliate; (ii) an acquirer of RIDEY

equity, business or assets; or (iii) a successor by merger. Any purported assignment in violation

of this section shall be void. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship

exists between you, RIDEY or any Third Party Provider as a result of this Agreement or use of

the Services. If any provision of these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable, such

provision shall be struck and the remaining provisions shall be enforced to the fullest extent

under law. RIDEYs’ failure to enforce any right or provision in these Terms shall not constitute

a waiver of such right or provision unless acknowledged and agreed to by RIDEY in writing.</p>
