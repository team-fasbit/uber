  information, unique device identifier <b>(&quot;UDID&quot;)</b> and/or your mobile operating system. We also

  collect geolocation data from visitors that download and open the App.<b> Please note that you can

  <p><b>3. How We Share and Disclose Information</b></p>
  <p>We know how important it is to keep your information confidential. We will not rent, sell or

  share your Personal Information with third parties except as specifically approved by you at the

  time of disclosure or under the circumstances described below.</p>
  <p>
  If you do not want us to use or disclose Personal Information collected about you in the ways

  identified in this Privacy Policy, you may choose not to (a) provide your Personal Information at

  any time or (b) download the App and become a Rider.
  </p>
  <p>
  In addition to using the information collected by us for the purposes described in Section 2

  above, we may also share your information as described below. Please review our sharing policy

  closely, especially with respect to your Personal Information. By becoming a Rider, you agree to

  allow us to share the Personal Information you provide to us in the ways described below. Your

  ability to make changes to what information is shared is also described below. In addition, by

  downloading and using the App, you agree to allow us to share your geolocation information as

  described below.
  </p>
  <ol class="count_ol">
  <li><b>a. Riders and Drivers</b><br/>

  <ol class="sub_ol">
  <li>
  We share certain information about Riders (e.g., name, rating, pick-up and drop-

  off locations, route information, profile picture) with Drivers to enable the

  scheduling and provision of Rides.
  </li>
  <li>Information provided on any ridey online forum or message board may be viewed

  by any Riders or Drivers who access the forum or board.</li>
  </ol>
  </li>
  <li><b>b. Service Providers</b><br/>

  <p>We also share Personal Information with vendors, payment providers, consultants and

  data processers who perform services on behalf of Ridey, including without limitation,

  companies that provide route guidance, estimated times of arrival, email services and host

  the Website, App and Service. We also share personal information with third parties that

  provide analysis, monitoring, and reports to assist us in preventing and detecting

  fraudulent transactions and other activity. Ridey has selected companies who maintain

  high standards with respect to privacy and agree to use the Personal Information only to

  perform specific services on behalf of Ridey and in accordance with the terms and

  conditions of this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>c. Compliance with Laws, Law Enforcement and Safety</b><br/>
  <p>We may disclose information we have collected about you if required to do so by law or

  if we, in our sole discretion, believe that disclosure is reasonable to comply with the law,

  requests or orders from law enforcement, or any legal process (whether or not such

  disclosure is required by applicable law), or to protect or defend Ridey&#39;s, or a third

  party&#39;s, rights or property. We may also reserve the right to disclose information we&#39;ve

  collected about you for purposes of protecting the health and safety of our Riders and

  Drivers, such as in the case of risk of harm or violence against any person.</p>
  </li>

  <li><b>d. Anonymous information</b><br/>
  <p>Aggregated Anonymous Information is the combination of your Anonymous Information

  with the Anonymous Information of other users (“Aggregated Anonymous Information”).

  Aggregated Anonymous Information does not allow you to be identified or contacted.

  We may share such Aggregated Anonymous Information with third parties, and,

  depending on the circumstances, we may or may not charge third parties for such

  information, or limit the third parties&#39; use of the same.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b>e. Business transactions</b><br/>
  <p>We may share all or some of your Personal Information with any of our parents,

  subsidiaries, joint venturers, or other companies under common control, in which case we

  will require them to honor this Privacy Policy. Additionally, in the event we undergo a

  business transition such as a merger, acquisition by another company, or sale of all or a

  portion of our assets, your Personal Information may be among the assets transferred.

  You acknowledge that such transfers may occur and are permitted by this Privacy Policy,

  and that any entity that acquires us, is merged with us or that acquires our assets may

  continue to process your Personal Information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.</p>
  </li>
  </ol>
  <b><p>4. Your Choices</p></b>
  <p>By becoming a Rider, you consent to receive certain communications from us. You may modify

  or opt out of receiving email or text messages sent for marketing purposes by adjusting your

  Account settings or following the unsubscribe instructions in such messages. Please note that

  despite any indicated marketing preferences, we may send you administrative messages

  regarding the Website, App or Service, including, for example, notices of updates to our Privacy

  Policy and invoices from Rides.</p>

  <b><p>5. Updating and/or Deleting Your Personal Information</p></b>
  <p>You may revise your Personal Information by adjusting your Account settings in the App. You

  may submit a request to delete your Personal Information by contacting us directly at

  <a href="mailto:support@goridey.com">support@goridey.com</a>. However, please note that we may be required to maintain certain

  Personal Information, or to maintain certain Personal Information for a period of time, in which

  case we will comply with your deletion request only after we have fulfilled such requirements.

  For instance, we may retain your Personal Information for fraud detection or similar purposes.

  Be advised that when we delete any Personal Information, it will be deleted from our active

  database, but may remain in our archives. Note that if we have already disclosed some of your

  Personal Information to third parties, we cannot access that Personal Information any longer and

  therefore cannot compel the deletion or modification of any such information by the parties to

  whom we have made those disclosures. Even after your Personal Information is deleted, we may

  maintain Anonymous Information from your Account (which, as a reminder, cannot be used to

  contact or identify you, and is not linked to information that can be used to do so) to use as part

  of Aggregated Anonymous Information for legitimate business purposes, including analyzing

  data metrics and conducting internal operations. See Section 3(d) for further information

  regarding Aggregated Anonymous Information.</p>

  <b><p>6. COPPA</p></b>
  <p>
  The Website, App and Service are not directed at or intended for anyone under 18 years of age.

  Additionally, in accordance with the Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act <b>(&quot;COPPA&quot;)</b>, we

  do not knowingly collect or solicit Personal Information from individuals under 13 years of age

  and no one under age 13 may provide any Personal Information to Ridey. If we later obtain

  actual knowledge that a Rider is under 13 years of age, we will take steps to remove that Rider&#39;s

  Personal Information from our systems and delete the Account. If you are the parent or guardian

  of a child whom you believe has disclosed Personal Information to us, please contact us at

  <a href="support@goridey.com">support@goridey.com</a> so that we may delete and remove such information from our systems.
  </p>
  <b><p>7. Security and Data Retention</p></b>
  <p>
  We are very concerned with safeguarding your information. We employ all reasonable

  administrative, physical and electronic measures designed to protect your information from

  unauthorized access. We will make any legally required disclosures of any breach of the security,

  confidentiality, or integrity of your unencrypted electronically stored &quot;personal data&quot; (as defined

  in applicable state statutes on security breach notification) to you via email, text or conspicuous

  posting on the Website in the most expedient time possible and without unreasonable delay,

  insofar as it is consistent with (i) the legitimate needs of law enforcement or (ii) any measures

  necessary to determine the scope of the breach and restore the reasonable integrity of the data

  system. Although guaranteed security does not exist either on or off the Internet, we make

  commercially reasonable efforts to make the collection and security of such information

  consistent with this Privacy Policy and all applicable laws and regulations.
  </p>
  <p>We will retain your Personal Information only for as long as necessary to fulfill the purpose(s)

  for which it was collected and to comply with applicable laws. Your consent to such purpose

  remains valid after termination of our relationship with you.</p>
  <b><p>8. Third Party Websites</p></b>
  <p>
  Ridey may provide links to other websites that may be of interest to our users. However, we are

  not responsible for the privacy practices employed by those websites, nor are we responsible for

  the information or content they contain. This Privacy Policy applies solely to information

  collected by us through the Website, App and Service; thus when you use a link to go from our

  website to another third party website, this Privacy Policy is no longer in effect. We encourage

  users to read and consider the privacy policies of these other websites before using them.
  </p>
  <b><p>9. Changes to Our Privacy Policy</p></b>
  <p>
  We reserve the right to change, modify, add or remove portions of this Privacy Policy at any

  time and without prior notice, and any changes will become effective immediately upon being

  posted unless we advise you otherwise. However, we will not use your Personal Information in a

  way that is materially different from the uses described in this Privacy Policy without giving you

  an opportunity to opt out. Your continued use of the Service after this Privacy Policy has been

  amended shall be deemed to be your continued acceptance of the terms and conditions of the

  Privacy Policy, as amended. We encourage you to bookmark this webpage and review this

  Privacy Policy regularly.
